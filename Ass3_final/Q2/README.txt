FIFO:
I have made a fifo named myfifo and i have generated 50 random strings which i am then sending using write then in another file(p2) I am reading these 5 strings received and then I am sending the highest index back to p1 using the same fifo by writing to it and then in p1 I am reading this and sending the next 5 strings. All of this is happening ina loop.

SOCKETS:
I am making a server and a client to communicate between the two paths.
